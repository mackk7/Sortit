# Sortit 📊

**Sortit** is a React-based interactive visualization tool that demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work in real-time. It provides a clean, visual representation of the sorting process, helping users understand algorithm efficiency and logic.

## 🚀 Features

* **5 Key Algorithms:** Visualizes Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, and Quick Sort.
* **Dynamic Controls:**
    * **Array Size:** Adjust the number of bars to sort.
    * **Speed Control:** Speed up or slow down the visualization to see comparisons clearly.
* **Color-Coded Feedback:**
    * **Comparison:** Highlights elements currently being compared.
    * **Swap:** Highlights elements being swapped.
    * **Sorted:** distinct color for the final sorted state.
* **Responsive:** Built with modern CSS to work on different screen sizes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Library:** React.js
* **Languages:** JavaScript (ES6), HTML5, CSS3
* **Deployment:** Vercel 

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

1.  **Bubble Sort:** Swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
2.  **Selection Sort:** Selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion and moves it to the sorted portion.
3.  **Insertion Sort:** Builds the sorted array one item at a time.
4.  **Merge Sort:** A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts them, and merges them.
5.  **Quick Sort:** Picks a 'pivot' element and partitions the array around the pivot.
